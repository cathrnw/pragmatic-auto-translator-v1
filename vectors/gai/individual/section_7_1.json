  "text": "PATHS FORWARD In order to mitigate the risks that come with the creation of increasingly large LMs, we urge researchers to shift to a mindset of careful planning, along many dimensions, before starting to build either datasets or systems trained on datasets. We should consider our research time and effort a valuable resource, to be spent to the extent possible on research projects that build towards a technological ecosystem whose benefits are at least evenly distributed or better accrue to those historically most marginalized. This means considering how research contributions shape the overall direction of the field and keeping alert to directions that limit access. Likewise, it means considering the financial and environmental costs of model development up front, before deciding on a course of investigation. The resources needed to train and tune state-of-the-art models stand to increase economic inequities unless researchers incorporate energy and compute efficiency in their model evaluations. Furthermore, the goals of energy and compute efficient model building and of creating datasets and models where the incorporated biases can be understood both point to careful curation of data. Significant time should be spent on assembling datasets suited for the tasks at hand rather than ingesting massive amounts of data from convenient or easily-scraped Internet sources. As discussed in ยง4.1, simply turning to massive dataset size as a strategy for being inclusive of diverse viewpoints is doomed to failure. We recall again Birhane and Prabhu's [18] words (inspired by Ruha Benjamin [15]): \"Feeding AI systems on the world's beauty, ugliness, and cruelty, but expecting it to reflect only the beauty is a fantasy.\" Citations: [[18]: ref_18] [[15]: ref_15] [Ref: ยง4.1 -> section_4_1] As a part of careful data collection practices, researchers must adopt frameworks such as [13, 52, 86] to describe the uses for which their models are suited and benchmark evaluations for a variety of conditions. This involves providing thorough documentation on the data used in model building, including the motivations underlying data selection and collection processes. This documentation should reflect and indicate researchers' goals, values, and motivations in assembling data and creating a given model. It should also make note of potential users and stakeholders, particularly those that stand to be negatively impacted by model errors or misuse. We note that just because a model might have many different applications doesn't mean that its developers don't need to consider stakeholders. An exploration of stakeholders for likely use cases can still be informative around potential risks, even when there is no way to guarantee that all use cases can be explored. Citations: [[13, 52, 86]: ref_13, ref_52, ref_86] We also advocate for a re-alignment of research goals: Where much effort has been allocated to making models (and their training data) bigger and to achieving ever higher scores on leaderboards often featuring artificial tasks, we believe there is more to be gained by focusing on understanding how machines are achieving the tasks in question and how they will form part of socio-technical systems. To that end, LM development may benefit from guided evaluation exercises such as pre-mortems [68]. Frequently used in business settings before the deployment of new products or projects, pre-mortem analyses center hypothetical failures and ask team members to reverse engineer previously unanticipated causes.25 Critically, pre-mortem analyses prompt team members to consider not only a range of potential known and unknown project risks, but also alternatives to current project plans. In this way, researchers can consider the risks and limitations of their LMs in a guided way while also considering fixes to current designs or alternative methods of achieving a task-oriented goal in relation to specific pitfalls. [Footnote 25]: This would be one way to build a evaluation culture that considers not only average-case performance (as measured by metrics) and best-case performance (cherry-picked examples), but also worst-case performance. Citations: [[68]: ref_68] Value sensitive design [49, 50] provides a range of methodologies for identifying stakeholders (both direct stakeholders who will use a technology and indirect stakeholders who will be affected through others' use of it), working with them to identify their values, and designing systems that support those values. These include such techniques as envisioning cards [48], the development of value scenarios [90], and working with panels of experiential experts [152]. These approaches help surface not only stakeholder values, but also values expressed by systems and enacted through interactions between systems and society [120]. For researchers working with LMs, value sensitive design is poised to help throughout the development process in identifying whose values are expressed and supported through a technology and, subsequently, how a lack of support might result in harm. Citations: [[49, 50]: ref_49, ref_50] [[48]: ref_48] [[90]: ref_90] [[152]: ref_152] [[120]: ref_120] All of these approaches take time and are most valuable when applied early in the development process as part of a conceptual investigation of values and harms rather than as a post-hoc discovery of risks [72]. These conceptual investigations should come before researchers become deeply committed to their ideas and therefore less likely to change course when confronted with evidence of possible harms. This brings us again to the idea we began this section with: that research and development of language technology, at once concerned with deeply human data (language) and creating systems which humans interact with in immediate and vivid ways, should be done with forethought and care. Citations: [[72]: ref_72] Finally, we would like to consider use cases of large LMs that have specifically served marginalized populations. If, as we advocate, the field backs off from the path of ever larger LMs, are we thus sacrificing benefits that would accrue to these populations? As a case in point, consider automatic speech recognition, which has seen some improvements thanks to advances in LMs, including both in size and in architecture [e.g. 8, 59, 121], though the largest LMs typically are too large and too slow for the near real-time needs of ASR systems [60]. Improved ASR has many beneficial applications, including automatic captioning which has the potential to be beneficial for Deaf and hard of hearing people, providing access to otherwise inaccessible audio content.26 We see two beneficial paths forward here: The first is a broader search for means of improving ASR systems, as indeed is underway, since the contexts of application of the technology aren't conducive to using ever larger LMs [60]. But even if larger LMs could be used, just because we've seen that large LMs can help doesn't mean that this is the only effective path to stronger ASR technology. (And we note that if we want to build strong ASR technology across most of the world's languages, we can't rely on having terabytes of data in all cases.) The second, should we determine that large LMs are critical (when available), is to recognize this as an instance of a dual use problem and consider how to mitigate the harms of LMs used as stochastic parrots while still preserving them for use in ASR systems. Could LMs be built in such a way that synthetic text generated with them would be watermarked and thus detectable [7, 66, 123]? Are there policy approaches that could effectively regulate their use? [Footnote 26]: Note however, that automatic captioning is not yet and likely may never be good enough to replace human-generated captions. Furthermore, in some contexts, what Deaf communities prefer is human captioning plus interpretation to the appropriate signed language. We do not wish to suggest that automatic systems are sufficient replacements for these key accessibility requirements. Citations: [[e.g. 8, 59, 121]: ref_8, ref_59, ref_121] [[60]: ref_60] [[7, 66, 123]: ref_7, ref_66, ref_123] In summary, we advocate for research that centers the people who stand to be adversely affected by the resulting technology, with a broad view on the possible ways that technology can affect people. This, in turn, means making time in the research process for considering environmental impacts, for doing careful data curation and documentation, for engaging with stakeholders early in the design process, for exploring multiple possible paths towards long-term goals, for keeping alert to dual-use scenarios, and finally for allocating research effort to harm mitigation in such cases.",
